# Dynamic-Connectivity-Algorithm

## Description

This repository contains a Java implementation of a percolation simulation implemented using dynamic connectivity algorithm, which models the behavior of a fluid percolating through a porous material. The simulation utilizes the Union-Find algorithm with time complexity O(lg(n)), efficient connectivity checks.

## Results
I got the percentage of open fields of around 59.2% while the scientific result is equal to 59.3%.
